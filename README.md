# backports-pathlib-relative-to

Since:

- There are several alternatives better positioned to maintain this functionality
- This package has a very too narrow scope
- This package has never left the beta state
- There are no known users of this package
- And to be honest, I don't have time to properly maintain this package

I have decided to withdraw the package from pypi and archive this repository.

Please refer to either:

- https://github.com/jazzband/pathlib2
- https://github.com/bitranox/pathlib3x

For backports of the pathlib module.
